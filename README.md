# MINI DATA-Analysis 1, STAT 545A 
## Berke Ucar - M.Sc. Bioinformatics

This repository is where the mini data project 1 of STAT 545A class has been stored under the name of Berke UCAR. The repository mainly contains the data exploration of the dataset _steam\_games_ of [_data\_teachr_](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/datateachr) package. It also additionally contains the dataset selection procedure before selecting _steam\_games_ and future directions for analysing the dataset in the 2nd milestone of the Mini Data-Analysis. 

In order to engage with this repository, only thing that is needed to be done is to navigate into _mini-project-1.md_ file. This file contains the github markdown version of the originally prepared _mini-project-1.rmd_ file. One can see the underlying code of  _mini-project-1.md_ by navigating into _mini-project-1.rmd_ file. Furthermore, the repository also contains the _mini-project-1\_files_ folder, which accomodates the plots of the _mini-project-1.md_ file. One can check the plots from that folder in a more detailed manner. 

In order to locally run _mini-project-1.rmd_ file, one should open this file in RStudio and knit the document using the *Knit* button located on the navigation bar. Furthermore, each knit generates a new _mini-project-1.md_ file and _mini-project-1\_files_ folder containing the _mini-project-1.md_ file's plots. So, if you need to preserve the previous run's output, you can change the .rmd file's name temporarily.
